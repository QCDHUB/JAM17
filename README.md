## Abstract

We perform the first global QCD analysis of polarized inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic 
scattering and single-inclusive e+e- annihilation data, simultaneously fitting the parton 
distribution and fragmentation functions using the iterative Monte Carlo method. Without imposing 
SU(3) symmetry relations, we find the strange polarization to be very small, consistent with zero 
for both inclusive and semi-inclusive data, which provides a resolution to the strange quark 
polarization puzzle. The combined analysis also allows the direct extraction from data of the 
isovector and octet axial charges, and is consistent with a small SU(2) flavor asymmetry in the 
polarized sea.
